                <div class="desc">The lesser goldfinch is native to North America, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos
                    Islands. The tiny bird averages 10 centimeters in size, and is particularly sexually dimorphic, with
                    significant coloration differences between males and females.

                    It’s a very common bird that’s found in multiple habitats at different elevations and has been
                    observed to be a predominantly monogamous bird.</div>

                <div class="desc">The golden-headed cisticola is also known as the bright-capped cisticola, and found
                    across South Asia and Australia. It has the nickname the “finest tailor of all birds” as it makes
                    its tidy nest from plants and spider threads.
                    Usually seen around grasslands in humid areas, the golden-headed cisticola is omnivorous, eating
                    everything from insects and small slugs to seeds. On average mature adults grow to 10 centimeters
                    and weigh around 8 grams.</div>

                <div class="desc">The verdin rivals the American bushtit as one of the smallest passerines in North
                    America and is found across Mexico and the southern USA. They nest in shrubs and thorny thickets
                    with few trees, building nests that are spherically inter-connected bulky twigs and branches lined
                    with feathers, grass, and hair.

                    They are commonly spotted foraging for insects among desert scrub plants.</div>

                    animal native to areas on the east coast of Australia. It usually lives in small groups of three or
                    four birds that forage together at all heights of the canopy, hunting flying insects amongst the
                    foliage.</div>

                <div class="desc">The pardalote is a particularly attractive Australian bird with bright patterned
                    plumage – and a plump look, unlike most of the other tiny birds on this list, even though they weigh
                    just 6 g. Their small size lets them get into small holes of eucalyptus trees to hunt for lerps and
                    other native larvae.

                    As with many other animals, the numbers of this stunning bird are in decline due to habitat loss
                    caused by humans for urban development and grazing domestic animals.</div>

                    almost as small, and very similar in appearance to the goldcrest, though has a more yellowish tinge
                    with a whitish fawn stripe above the eye.

                    Simple firecrests tend to be seen more frequently during autumn and winter when it’s easier to spot
                    them picking off small insects to eat.</div>

                    length, and weighing a tiny 6 grams. Its Latin name means prince or little king, and it’s sometimes
                    referred to as the king of the birds in folklore.

                    They have thin beaks that are ideally suited for picking insects out from between pine needles and
                    are easily recognised by the black and yellow stripe on their heads (which includes an orange center
                    on males).</div>

                    smallest bird. Favouring eucalyptus-rich areas, they have a diet that’s based on larvae and small

                    camelus) is the biggest bird in the world.

                    It’s both the tallest and heaviest, with an average height of over 2 meters (sometimes as tall as
                    2.8 meters) and a weight of up to 160 kg. At this size, the ostrich is, of course, a flightless
                    bird, but can outrun plenty of animals with its top speed of 69 km per hour, which makes it the
                    fastest animal on two legs.</div>

                    Ethiopia and Kenya, the Somali ostrich is generally a little lighter than it’s common ostrich
                    cousin, but is just as impressive with its running speed, and is able to cover 5 meters in a single

                    These swans look graceful and elegant but have a dangerous side when defending their families or
